# Short Project Description:
This project focuses on developing NeuronPay, an AI-powered payment system that enhances security by using eye-pattern recognition for authentication instead of traditional OTPs or biometric methods. The system simulates a mock payment process that:
Uses AI-powered authentication to replace OTPs with eye-pattern recognition for secure verification.
Integrates frontend built using React and Tailwind CSS, backend powered by Flask, and SQLite for database storage.
Aims to improve payment security and user experience by leveraging AI for fraud detection.

# Technologies Used:
Frontend:
React (for building the user interface)
Tailwind CSS (for styling the app)
Backend:
Flask (for backend API development)
SQLite (for database storage)
AI Model:
Python (for AI model development)
OpenCV (for image processing and eye pattern detection)
TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning and AI model building)
Tools:
VS Code (for development)
Git/GitHub (for version control)

# Steps to Run/Execute the Project:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2301730207_Sudhanshu_Ranjan_Singh_Ai-powered-Smart-Payment-System.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd 2301730207_Sudhanshu_Ranjan_Singh_Ai-powered-Smart-Payment-System

Install Required Libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up the Database:
python setup_database.py

Run the Backend:
python app.py

Run the Frontend:

cd client

npm install

npm start

# Testing the Payment System:
Once both the frontend and backend are running, open the application in your browser (usually accessible at http://localhost:3000).
Create a user profile and link a bank account.
Proceed with the mock payment process using AI-powered eye-pattern recognition for authentication.

# Hardware Requirements:
Webcam: Required to capture eye patterns for authentication.
Computer: Any machine that supports Python, Node.js, and all necessary dependencies.

# Future Enhancements:
Implement real-time AI-powered fraud detection.
Integrate with actual payment gateways for live transactions.
Deploy the application to the cloud for better scalability and robustness.
Develop a mobile app version of NeuronPay for greater accessibility.
